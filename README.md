# Auto-Password-Generator
An auto password generator software is designed to create strong, random, and secure passwords based on user-defined criteria. The functionality typically includes options to specify the length of the password and select character types such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. The software uses a cryptographically secure random number generator to ensure unpredictability and security. Some implementations also provide additional features like avoiding ambiguous characters (e.g., 'O' and '0'), enforcing complexity rules, and generating multiple passwords at once. Advanced versions may include a password history tracker, the ability to copy passwords to the clipboard securely, and integration with password managers for seamless storage and retrieval. The generated passwords are displayed to the user in a secure manner, often with an option to hide or reveal them. For further security, some tools implement expiration timers or temporary password generation for one-time use.
